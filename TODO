documentation:
  M:
    - figure out version-dependency of fields & section (missing extra data section -> how, when, what versions?)
    - document special PX version too?
  *:
    - add rest of PMD-related formats

implementation:
  - keep simple, dumb parser in sync with documented details (no time right now)
